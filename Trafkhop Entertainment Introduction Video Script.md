You may wonder what we do and thats what this video is for

History

First of I, Daniel aka HoppiTex, founded Trafkhop in late December of 2025, so i could publish my stuff under a studio.

I had been working on my ideas since august, so i already had a bunch of stuff. I also already made a lot of bad Scratch Games at that point, so i used the newely founded studio to release a itch.io collection of most of them.

I also made a website with Github Pages, where i now store all of my ideas and infos related to Trafkhop.

Currently i am in the writing phase, but i am also learning Blender, FL-Studio and Godot at the moment for my future games.

Our Specialtys

I'm designing a vast and unique Triverse, yes triverse. Its a triverse, because there are 3 verses, we have the all, where the Mana(as i call it Zauberkraft) resides, its a infinitly small place with infinitly things in it. We alse have the None, a place where not even Matter is allowed to exist. Its infinitly big, but also infinitly empty. Finally we have "our" Universe. Yes i wrote in our Universe, but with slight tweaks like the locations look a bit different and some history has been rewritten or moved from fantaly to reallity (even the people in the fincional universe don't know that most of ficion is true in some sense until a certain point). Anyway, thats the Triverse in its most basic form, we will come back to it later.

I also made a "completly unique" magicsystem, where every spell is like stacking blocks on another to create new ones. Want a flying fireball, stack a permanent persistance block with a shotblock and a gravityless block and you have a fireball that can shoot in a streight line until it hits something. Of course we made it also math based so you can calculate how many Levels, yes it is based on SI units, its just a Liter, a Level is a Liter of Mana, you have and how big you can make the fireball, because of course in the background, its calculated. If you wanna know, its Volume * sum(attributes).

So We have a unique magic system, but what about our worlds, there must be more than our Universe and some empty place thats infinitly big and a place that has everything but is infinitly small. Aaand you'd be corrent.

We have 12 Unique Words excluding our interpretation of the Universe.
Those 12 Worlds are all in the Noneverse.
"But you said not even Matter is allowed to exist", thats only the half truth. In reallity in the none, there are NO rules, it doesnt have the rule that allows matter to exist, so in theory nothing can exist. EXCEPT Mana, wich wants to transform the none into an antinone, a place where things can exist, it wants to make the none and the all the same and wants to combine the 2. Therefore the Mana adds those missing rules to the none and tries to make it habitable. But it always fails for some reason or another, then the none is reset, the rules are removed and the mana tries agein. Our stories mostly play in the try, where the mana hat not eough mana to apply the matter existanz rule, so it creates a REALLY big bubble, a Antimanabubble, as we call it a Trafkbubble. Antimana or as it is officially called Trafk is the inverse of Mana, seathrough, sticky and slow. Trafk builds up when mana doesnt have a use and turns itself into antimana for later use. It forms bubbles with a thin wall and a big, empty midde, wich is in itself a whole nother verse, inside of a Trafkbubble there can by any rule applied and with that knowlage we can understand, that only a Trafkbubble can survive in the none. Anyways the Mana made the bubble and inside of that it created Ursel.
